How to make requests
<script>
    let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();//XML http req
    xhr.open('GET', "time", true);//This defines it is a get request for the directory "time"
    xhr.send();

    xhr.onreadystatechange = function (e) {//As this is asynchronous this defines the function that will be called once the response has been recieved
        if (xhr.readyState == 4 && xhr.status == 200) {//Ready state 4 is the state which means done and status 200 means no errors, so exectue the code below
            let response = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);//gets the json of the response
            console.log(response);//Logs it in the console
        }
    };

    //This seconds request makes a get request on a page with parameters so you could for example request the profile for
    //user with id of 134234214 by doing a request on the url "/users?userID="134234214" (you cant actually do this in the program
    //right now this is just an example of how you could use it)

    //This example below just sends data off to the server and the server responds with the same data

    xhr2 = new XMLHttpRequest();//XML http req
    xhr2.open('GET', "/data?user=me&id=0", true);//The difference this time is its making a request on the directroy data with paremeter user and id, the question mark represents the start of variables
    xhr2.send();

    xhr2.onreadystatechange = function (e) {//As this is asynchronous this defines the function that will be called once the response has been recieved
        if (xhr2.readyState == 4 && xhr2.status == 200) {//Ready state 4 is the state which means done and status 200 means no errors, so exectue the code below
            let response = JSON.parse(xhr2.responseText);//gets the json of the response
            console.log(response);//Logs it in the console
        }
    };

    //Will do example on how to do post requests later on
    RequestData();
